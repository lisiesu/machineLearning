# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my **Machine Learning** repository! This is where I'll be documenting my learning journey by creating small projects as I explore various machine learning concepts and techniques.

## Repository Structure

The main structure of this repository is as follows:

```
machineLearning/
â”‚â”€â”€ projects/         # Contains individual machine learning projects
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project1/     # Each project has its own folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

### Projects

Each project inside the `projects/` folder will have:
- A descriptive `README.md` explaining the goal, approach, and any relevant details.
- The necessary code files, datasets (if applicable), and any dependencies.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:
- Learn machine learning by building small, hands-on projects.
- Keep track of my progress and understanding over time.
- Potentially share my work with others who are also learning ML.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the `projects/` folder to explore different projects.
2. Each project will have instructions on how to run it, along with explanations of the concepts used.
3. Feel free to follow along, try the projects yourself, or even suggest improvements!

Iâ€™m excited to dive into the world of machine learning, one project at a time! ðŸš€
